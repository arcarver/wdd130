            "When you go on the river,
            wear a life jacket.
            I once had search and rescue called beacuse I
            tipped over in kayak and my upside down kayak floated down
            the Provo River.
            Because I wore my life-jacket I am alive today.
            
            I live near Seattle, Washington with my sweet husband and five
            beautiful children, and a dog.
            In the summer we swim and hike. In the winter we go into the mountians to find snow and go sledding.
            Our dog tolerates swimming.  He has a lifejacket and paddles as fast as he can towards the shore. He 
            only tolerates the water.
            In the winter we play a lot of boardgames.  My favorite is Ticket to Ride Legacy. On of my children 
            loves to play Five Crowns.  They are a card shark.  Don't tell my them I told you. They almost always
            win in card games."
