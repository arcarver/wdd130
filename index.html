            "When you go on the river,
            wear a life jacket.
            I once had search and rescue called beacuse I
            tipped over in kayak and my upside down kayak floated down
            the Provo River.
            Because I wore my life-jacket I am alive today.
            I live near Seattle, Washington with my sweet husband and five
            beautiful children, and a dog."
